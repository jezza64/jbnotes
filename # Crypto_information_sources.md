development:

Not interested in certifications - just in becoming highly proficient/SME in development (#solidity, #rust, etc.), #DeFi, #NFT, #DAOs. Committed to investing in myself as much as #crypto

I come from the cyber-security space and have already been thru some great training around securing smart contracts/blockchains. The course was SEC544: Blockchain & Smart Contract Security put on by the SANS Institute

The training opened my eyes to how much I still don't know. Appreciate any/all insights from The Exchange...Cheers

I would recommend joining a DAO and taking some side projects with them. Your would probably be paid for you work with their native tokens. Or you could jump into a hackathon on GitHub. I would jump on the discord channels and look aroundâ€¦ maybe start with the Bankless DAO or Sovryn if you want EVM compatible BTC Defi. Find something you interested in and start helping out. Do you know what type work you are wanting to start with?
