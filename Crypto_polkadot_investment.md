### Vega protocol VEGA

https://vega.xyz/use/

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that Vega Protocol (“VEGA”), a portfolio project of KR1, has completed a successful US$5 million funding round led by Arrington Capital and Cumberland DRW. The funding round included participation from previous backers, as well as new backers like Coinbase Ventures and ParaFi Capital.

KR1 is also pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the recent funding round,  investing a further US$150,000 in exchange for 194,999.17 VEGA tokens at a price of US$0.77 per token. This investment comes in addition to KR1’s seed round participation, announced in October 2019. Across both funding rounds, the Company now holds a total of 842,493.91 VEGA tokens.

Vega is a decentralised derivatives protocol that allows anyone to launch markets and eliminates centralised gatekeepers to provide high throughput, low-fee trading in a capital efficient way. In doing so, the protocol bridges the immense industry of derivatives in traditional finance with the still nascent and rapidly evolving world of decentralised finance. Vega is currently advancing towards its mainnet release, with future plans including self-custodied cross-chain collateral, a trustless bridge into the Ethereum ecosystem, as well as bridges into other major blockchains such as Bitcoin, Polkadot and Cosmos.

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Vega is one of the most anticipated projects in our portfolio and we are very happy to be able to support the team again in this latest round, especially considering the incredible progress they have ade. A core excitement of the blossoming decentralised finance ecosystem has always been about the potential to open up financial infrastructure for everyone in a fair way and Vega will prove to be a major step change towards this becoming a mainstream reality.”

### XPN Exponent

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$500,000 into the Exponent project in return for a yet-to-be-determined amount of XPN tokens. KR1 led the seed funding round and was joined by a network of strategic investors including AngelDAO, Block0, GSR Markets, Golden Gate Ventures, Taureon Capital, Varys Capital, and several prominent blockchain protocol founders and individuals.

Exponent is an open-source platform that equips strategists with the necessary tools and infrastructure to bring quantitative trading to decentralised  finance (“DeFi”). Built by an experienced team of engineers and strategists, the Exponent platform takes care of, both, DeFi integrations and trade execution, allowing strategists to easily launch active strategies with the supporting tools and infrastructure. Additionally, end-users can choose from a selection of vaults with various alpha strategies while retaining custody of their assets.

The Founders of Exponent commented:

“We’re thrilled to on-board KR1 as one of our earliest investors - similar to how you form a founding team, selecting your early investors is equally as critical to get right. The individuals in the KR1 team are early adopters of the Web3 space and understand the challenges entrepreneurs face. Over the years, they have proven to be a trusted and consistent long term partner for entrepreneurs. We are excited to be working closely with them to bring financial empowerment and freedom to everyone, globally.”

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Exponent is a much-needed service that takes quant-driven DeFi investing to the next level. Building on top of Enzyme, another portfolio project of ours, and led by a stellar team, we believe Exponent will spawn an important community of strategists and hedge funds that are going to drive significant value into DeFi. We are tremendously excited to be supporting them on their journey.”

#### my notes

Can't find this as a crowd loan.

### Basilisk / Hydra DX

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the Basilisk crowdloan and Kusama (“KSM”) parachain auction. KR1 contributed a total of 11,111.1 KSM to the Basilisk crowdloan campaign.

Basilisk is a liquidity bootstrapping protocol built for Kusama, enabling frictionless liquidity for the long tail of crypto assets through a modular design. Basilisk’s first release offers an implementation of a liquidity bootstrapping pool as well as pools with order matching transactions. Future releases will bring more advanced price discovery mechanisms to Basilisk, such as auctions and bonding curves.

The contributed KSM will be time-locked on the Kusama blockchain for 48 weeks and will be returned to the Company following the completion of the respective Basilisk parachain lease. Following the successful Basilisk parachain auction bid, KR1 is going to receive a to-be-determined amount of Basilisk (“BSX”) tokens in return for supporting the Basilisk crowdloan campaign. In addition, the Company will also receive a yet-to-be-determined amount of BSX tokens in line with KR1’s previous backing of HydraDX’s seed funding round, which will be confirmed in a future announcement.

This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital. Instead, it is an indirect investment with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked KSM funds as well as foregoing any staking yields on the contributed KSM for the time period.

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Basilisk is an exciting community focused project run by an exceptional team of crypto thinkers. As a permanent deployment on Kusama, Basilisk has strong synergies with Polkadot-facing HydraDX, which, together, will cater to the varying liquidity needs of crypto assets throughout their life cycles. Projects can bootstrap liquidity in the early stages using a Basilisk pool, then later move to the HydraDX omnipool to unlock unprecedented cross-chain liquidity in an ‘ocean of assets’.”

### Interlay (InterBTC on polkadot, KINT Kintsugi on Kusama)

#### InterBTC

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$269,892 into Interlay Ltd. (“Interlay”), in return for 1,224 Series Seed Shares in Interlay. KR1 invested alongside respected investors such as IOSG Ventures, who led the round, and others including Hypersphere, Zee Prime Ventures and CMS Holdings.

Interlay is currently building out its flagship product ‘interBTC’, a fully collateralized one-to-one Bitcoin-backed asset that enables interoperability between multiple blockchain ecosystems while fully preserving Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant nature. At its core, interBTC leverages the concept of trustless and efficient cross-chain exchanges using cryptocurrency-backed assets introduced in previous research published by the Interlay team. interBTC will launch as a parachain on Polkadot and, once launched, can be utilised on Ethereum, Cosmos, Kusama and other networks in a seamless way through Polkadot’s interoperability technology.

Alexei Zamyatin, CEO and Co-Founder of Interlay, commented:

"We are extremely pleased to have the support of top investors from various ecosystems and geographic locations, who believe in our mission to bring Bitcoin to all major blockchains such as Polkadot, Ethereum and Cosmos. Together, we will accelerate the development and adoption of interBTC and allow people to invest, earn and pay with BTC on any blockchain in a truly trustless and decentralised way."

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Bitcoin continues to be the highest valued asset in the digital asset ecosystem by a wide margin but,  compared to other base-layer blockchains, it is lacking on-chain opportunities to engage in, such as decentralised finance. interBTC is going to unlock a new wave of innovation for Bitcoin holders across multiple blockchains and serves as a prime example of decentralisation working to provide services that anyone can use without worrying about trust.”

#### Kintsugi

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the Kintsugi crowdloan and Kusama (“KSM”) parachain auction. KR1 contributed a total of 5,000 KSM to the Kintsugi crowdloan campaign.

Kintsugi is interBTC’s canary network on Kusama that allows users to create kBTC, a one-to-one Bitcoin-backed asset, maintained by a decentralised network through collateralised Bitcoin vaults. Kintsugi’s kBTC brings Bitcoin to Kusama, enhancing liquidity on various other Kusama parachains such as Karura, Shiden, Moonriver or Basilisk.

The contributed KSM will be time-locked on the Kusama blockchain for 48 weeks and will be returned to the Company following the completion of the respective Kintsugi parachain lease. Upon a successful Kintsugi parachain auction bid, KR1 will receive a to-be-determined amount of Kintsugi (“KINT”) tokens in return for supporting the Kintsugi crowdloan campaign. In addition, the Company will also receive a yet-to-be-determined amount of KINT tokens in line with KR1’s previous backing of Interlay’s seed funding round, which will be confirmed in a future announcement.

This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital, instead, it is an indirect investment with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked KSM funds as well as foregoing any staking yields on the contributed KSM for the time period.

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Kintsugi marks the start of a fully trustless bridge for Bitcoin into the interconnected world of Kusama. This allows holders of Bitcoin, the most widely distributed crypto asset, to expand into a new world of applications and use cases and we are proud to support Kintsugi’s vision.”

### Moonbeam (GLMR on Polkadot / MOVR Moonriver on Kusama)

#### Moonriver

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the Moonriver (“MOVR”) crowdloan and Kusama (“KSM”) parachain auction. KR1 contributed a total of 5,000 KSM to the Moonriver crowdloan campaign, which successfully secured the second parachain slot in the previous round of Kusama parachain auctions.

Moonriver is a community-led Ethereum-compatible smart contracts platform on Kusama, acting as a permanently incentivised canary network of the Moonbeam project. 

Subsequent to the successful Moonriver parachain auction bid, KR1 received an initial unlocked tranche of 19,666.35 MOVR and is expecting to gradually receive a further estimated 45,888.15 MOVR over a period of 48 weeks.

The contributed KSM are time-locked on the Kusama blockchain for a period of 48 weeks and will be returned to the Company following the completion of the respective Moonriver parachain lease. This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital, instead, it is an indirect investment, with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked KSM funds, as well as, foregoing any staking yields on the contributed KSM for the time period.

The Company is also pleased to announce that it has already realised a part of its initial tranche of received Moonriver (“MOVR”) tokens, having sold a total of 15,643.19 MOVR and, in turn, having purchased a total of 5,162.25 KSM with the entire proceeds from this sale. 

As at the date of this announcement, the Company continues to hold 4,023.16 unlocked MOVR and is expecting to receive a further estimated 45,888.15 MOVR tokens in line with its parachain auction contribution, suggesting a total position of 49,911.31 MOVR. Also, following the purchase of KSM as well as KSM staking rewards generated since the Company’s last Kusama staking update, KR1 now holds a total of 48,057.89 KSM as at the date of this announcement.

In contrast to other Kusama sister networks, the Moonbeam Foundation opted for not granting any MOVR tokens to the founding team or to previous backers of Moonbeam-focused funding rounds, thereby laying the foundation for a strong community-led network. 

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“It is fantastic to see the excitement within the Kusama community for Moonriver, as well as the many other extremely well coordinated launches of technically sophisticated parachains.  Moonriver and the entire team have our full support and we are looking forward to developers taking advantage of Moonriver’s Ethereum-like environment that is fully compatible with existing tools and protocols.”

“Considering the exceptional traction of MOVR in the secondary markets, we had to find a balance as a Company and could not pass on the opportunity to realise some profits on our contributed KSM. This partial exit allows us to be an even more active participant in further upcoming parachain auctions and is also strengthening our staking activities going forward.”

#### Moonbeam

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that Moonbeam (“GLMR”), a portfolio project of KR1 and one of the most prominent projects building on Polkadot, has completed a successful US$6 million strategic funding round led by CoinFund alongside Binance Labs and ParaFi Capital. The round included participation from Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi Capital, IOSG Ventures, and all previous seed investors.

KR1 is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in this recent funding round, investing a further US$150,000 into Moonbeam in exchange for 30,000.00 GLMR tokens. This investment comes in addition to KR1’s seed round participation, announced in October 2020. Across both funding rounds, the Company now holds a total of 130,000.00 GLMR.

Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and dApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. 

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“We’re very excited to follow on our initial investment, as Derek and the whole Moonbeam team have shown huge progress. Moonbeam is now well positioned to come to market as one of the most anticipated networks building on Polkadot. Another major indicator of their success is the number of other projects integrating with Moonbeam already, including some of the best-known platforms in DeFi.”

### Redstone

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$100,000 into the RedStone project, in return for a-yet-to-be determined amount of RedStone tokens. KR1 invested in this first RedStone financing round, led by Maven 11 and joined by other prominent investors such as 1kx and Bering Waters.

RedStone is a next-generation cross-chain data oracle technology that offers fast and cost-efficient access to data, a full historic audit trail and an insurance-backed decentralised dispute mechanism, that provides users with recourse in the event of inaccurate data provision.  The project utilises permanent and affordable storage of the Arweave blockchain to keep data and track reputation, while integrating with a range of EVM-compatible chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche or Polygon, where the majority of all decentralised finance activity takes place.

Jakub Wojciechowski, CEO and Founder of RedStone Finance, commented:

“DeFi has experienced a colossal expansion, yet the oracle technology is lagging behind with the infrastructure created years ago. RedStone is looking to fill that gap by offering fast, cost-efficient and convenient tools for providing data to blockchain protocols. I am privileged to be surrounded by a group of very experienced investors who can help RedStone to reach its full potential.”

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“RedStone stands out in the crowded world of blockchain oracle solutions in providing a real edge with regards to cost savings, latency, auditability and insurance. We are already seeing the project starting to gain traction and we are thrilled to fund Jakub and his team in his new endeavour.”

### Divergence (DIVER)

https://www.divergence-protocol.com/

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$400,000  into Divergence (“DIVER”) in return for 20,666,666.67 DIVER tokens. KR1 led the seed and private funding round, together with Mechanism Capital, with participation from other notable funds including P2P Capital, Arrington Capital and Digital Finance Group.

Divergence is a decentralised platform for volatility hedging and advanced financial products centred around blockchain-native asset prices. The Divergence team is currently developing a range of decentralised volatility derivatives and volatility index products with the aim of becoming the go-to platform for risk-averse users seeking to hedge both one-sided and two-sided volatility risks,  risk-tolerant users seeking to trade and gain leveraged exposure to volatility, as well as risk-neutral users seeking to participate as liquidity providers by funding volatility markets and earning fees.

Lianne Li and Bonna Zhu, both Co-Founders of Divergence, commented:

"From the very beginning, KR1 has shared in, and committed to, the long-term vision we have for building volatility-based derivatives for the DeFi ecosystem. We are deeply honoured to have the opportunity of working with the KR1 team and cannot speak highly enough of their incredible intellectual rigour and staunch support for every aspect of our endeavours."

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“One of crypto’s big problems is extreme volatility and Divergence offers an innovative solution for liquidity providers, market makers and enthused community members, to allow them to profit from volatility with higher capital efficiency. With an impressive team, solid incentivisation mechanisms and a great mission, Divergence is a key part of the new era of the DeFi movement.”

#### My notes

Interesting application.
Release not until 2022.
Possible engagement via testing / LQ?

### ITG iTrust

https://www.itrust.finance/

The Company is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$100,000 in the iTrust seed funding round in return for a yet-to-be-determined amount of iTrust (“ITG”) tokens.

iTrust is a yield optimisation platform for supplying smart contract cover to the decentralised finance ecosystem. Underwriting smart contract cover is risky and complex for most users to perform, but iTrust’s algorithmic capital allocation engine and advanced protocol risk modelling, allows anyone the generation of low risk yields from smart contract cover provision. 

The iTrust team have many years of experience across a wide range of sectors and, although a nascent area of growth within the Blockchain world, the team have been involved in the decentralised insurance space since its inception. iTrust is also the first official cover supply partner of Nexus Mutual and Tidal Finance, also KR1 investments.

#### My notes

Lots of opportunities to make money from interacting.

### Clover (CLV)

The Company is also pleased to announce that it has invested a total of US$50,000 in the Clover project in return for 625,000 Clover (“CLV”) tokens.

Clover is a smart contract platform that enables Ethereum developers to easily migrate their decentralised applications onto Polkadot by minimizing the changes required to run existing Solidity smart contracts on the new network.

The platform offers some novel innovations, including a ‘smart relayer’ that allows users to cover gas fees with any token, removing the dependence on a base currency like Ether. Clover has also created a cross-chain explorer covering Ethereum, Polkadot and Binance Smart Chain as well as an innovative incentivisation layer, allowing dApp builders to automatically gain a percentage share of the transaction fees running through the network. This redistribution of fees is designed to ensure a vibrant developer community and foster an innovative DeFi ecosystem.

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“We are very pleased to support these two projects and we look forward to helping them bring their platforms to the ever-expanding decentralised finance ecosystem. Building a product on top of Nexus Mutual among others, enables iTrust to make the most of the composability effects of DeFi and in turn pushes the growth of the entire decentralised insurance vertical. With Clover, many new key innovations will be brought to market, not only ensuring a strong link between Ethereum and Polkadot but also bringing much needed choice and flexibility to developers and users alike.”

#### Astar

Dec 21

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the Astar (“ASTR”) crowdloan and Polkadot (“DOT”) parachain auction. KR1 contributed a total of 350,000.00 DOT to the Astar crowdloan campaign, which successfully secured the third parachain slot in the ongoing round of Polkadot parachain auctions.

Astar is a Polkadot-native, highly scalable decentralised application (“dApp”) platform that allows developers to build secure and scalable applications, supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine and WebAssembly. A core feature of Astar includes ‘dApps staking’, an innovative and blockchain-specific ‘Build-to-Earn’ monetisation model for Web3 developers, aiming to attract talented teams and prominent DeFi, DAO and NFT projects.

The contributed DOT will be time-locked on the Polkadot blockchain for 96 weeks and will be returned to the Company following the completion of the respective Astar parachain lease. Following the successful Astar parachain auction bid, KR1 is going to receive a to-be-determined amount of Astar (“ASTR”) tokens over a time period of 96 weeks in return for supporting the Astar crowdloan campaign.

This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital, instead, it is an indirect investment with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked DOT funds as well as foregoing any staking yields on the contributed DOT for the time period.

In addition, following Astar’s token redenomination, the Company will receive a total of  31,428,565.2 ASTR tokens in line with KR1 plc’s previous participations in Astar’s lockdrop token distribution events.

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Astar winning the third Polkadot parachain slot is a big achievement and speaks to the quality of the project and their continuous inclusion of the community since the first lockdrop campaign before Polkadot even launched. Astar joining the ranks of Acala and Moonbeam allows them to execute on their vision of a multi chain world for developers and users and we are excited to support Sota and his team with our contribution.”

#### Shiden

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce the Company’s participation in the Shiden crowdloan and upcoming Kusama (“KSM”) parachain auction. KR1 contributed a total of 10,000 KSM, equivalent to US$4,449,700 at the time of the contribution, to the Shiden crowdloan campaign.

Shiden natively supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine, WebAssembly and multiple Layer 2 solutions from day one, which enables various applications like DeFi, NFTs and more. 

The contributed KSM will be time-locked on the Kusama blockchain for a period of 48 weeks and will be returned to the Company following the completion of the respective Shiden parachain lease. Upon a successful Shiden parachain auction bid, KR1 will receive a to-be-determined amount of Shiden (“SDN”) tokens in return for supporting the Shiden crowdloan campaign. In addition, the Company will also receive a yet-to-be-determined amount of SDN tokens in line with KR1’s previous participation in Plasm's (“PLM”) first and second lockdrop campaign, which will be confirmed in a future announcement.

This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital, instead, it is an indirect investment, similar to the Company’s previous participations in ‘lockdrops’, with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked KSM funds as well as foregoing any staking yields on the contributed KSM for the time period.

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“The crowdloans kick-off and initiation of parachain auctions are a historic milestone for Kusama, Polkadot and the wider ecosystem. While delivering bleeding edge technology, the Polkadot and parachain teams are also continuing to innovate in token distribution mechanisms, which will prove to be hugely beneficial for the blockchain community.”

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Plasm’s Shiden Network on Kusama offers developers an improved scalability model, high transaction throughput, cross-chain interoperability, and considerably less time to market to deploy their decentralised applications. Sota, Founder of Plasm, and his team are standout entrepreneurs in the blockchain world and we are honoured to continue to back them and their vision.”

In addition, the Company will also receive a yet-to-be-determined amount of KAR tokens in line with KR1’s previous backing of Acala’s seed funding round and strategic funding round, all of which will be confirmed in a future announcement.

This method of token distribution involves no direct investment of capital, instead, it is an indirect investment, similar to the Company’s previous participations in ‘lockdrops’, with the opportunity costs being the inaccessibility of the locked KSM funds as well as foregoing any staking yields on the contributed KSM for the time period.

George McDonaugh, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“The crowdloans kick-off and initiation of parachain auctions are a historic milestone for Kusama, Polkadot and the wider ecosystem. While delivering bleeding edge technology, the Polkadot and parachain teams are also continuing to innovate in token distribution mechanisms, which will prove to be hugely beneficial for the blockchain community.”

“This participation shows our strength of conviction with Bette, Ruitao and the whole Acala team to execute on the vision of Karura. Karura is set to become the primary DeFi hub for the Kusama ecosystem, creating a new platform for innovation and limitless potential for new cross-chain decentralised financial services. This could be the big bang event for cross-chain DeFi.”

Looks good roadmap.

https://www.ata.network/

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that Automata (“ATA”), a portfolio project of KR1, has completed a successful US$2.4 million strategic funding round that included participation from IOSG Ventures and Jump Trading.

KR1 is also pleased to announce the Company’s participation in this recent funding round, investing a further US$200,000 into Automata in exchange for 5,000,000 ATA tokens. This investment comes in addition to KR1’s seed round participation, announced in March 2021. Across both funding rounds, the Company now holds a total of 15,000,000 ATA.

Automata Network is a decentralised service protocol that provides a privacy middleware layer for multiple platforms to achieve privacy, high assurance and frictionless computation.

The Automata team recently launched their first product ‘Witness’, an off-chain governance solution for voters that do not wish to reveal their identity while participating in governance at zero cost, which supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other Substrate-based EVM-compatible chains.

In addition, Automata Network is also developing a ‘Miner-Extractable-Value’ minimisation solution, ‘Conveyor’, which aims to solve the front-running issues as it ensures that transactions  are arranged in a way that makes it impossible for malicious actors to exploit other participants.

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“From Automata’s technical progress to the partnerships made one after the other with the industry leading projects, it is apparent that Automata has both the vision and the ability to execute. Our support of Automata Network speaks to our commitment to the sustainable development of a privacy-focused decentralised web, and we look forward to seeing more great work from the team.”

The Directors of KR1 plc accept responsibility for this announcement.

Investment: Equilibrium

KR1 plc (KR1:AQSE), a leading digital asset investment company, is pleased to announce that the Company has invested a total of US$250,000 into Equilibrium (“EQ”), in return for 595,238  EQ tokens. KR1 invested alongside respected investors such as Hypersphere Ventures and CMS Holdings.

Equilibrium is a decentralised interoperable money market built on Polkadot. The project attempts to solve the fragmentation issue of DeFi across multiple protocols and addresses the absence of cross-chain interoperability. As a product, Equilibrium combines a lending platform with a professional-grade cross-chain decentralised exchange, stablecoins, synthetic assets, margin trading, and perpetual swaps in one easy interface.

Alex Melikhov, CEO and Co-Founder of Equilibrium, commented:

"In the latest round, we were seeking value-add partners rather than just investors. We are excited to have KR1 on board as they are one of the most reputable and established crypto funds in the ecosystem. Given the coming parachain auctions on Kusama and Polkadot, you simply cannot get there without support from some of the influential players."

Keld van Schreven, Managing Director and Co-Founder of KR1, commented:

“Equilibrium has a bold vision of how a next generation DeFi platform should look like. Using Polkadot as its base layer, we are excited about Equilibrium’s potential to unlock and expand DeFi to an as yet untapped range of digital assets. As a new place to lend, borrow, trade and stake digital assets, it is going to be a major player in the ecosystem, and we are very excited to support Alex and his team on their journey.”
