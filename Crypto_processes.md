## Staking

### DOT

polkadot.js is the custom wallet with all functions.  
ledger does the same, maybe less interest?  
Bonding is for 28 days notice, where you can't stake and can't withdraw.  
Bonded can be put with validators  
get about 10% interest  

DOT accounts need to have at least one DOT in an account or it gets reaped.
Fees are fixed in DOT. Can send tip to try to get into an earlier block. But it's fast, new blocks every 6 seconds.  

#### Validator choice

Validators are block producers
Nominators are provide stake to the validators
Nominating means choose validators  
Only some validators can be chosen to be active
Top staked validators get in. They rely on nominators to choose them. Most validators don't get in.
Get tokens for staking.  
Generally most validators give the same block rewards, but distributed based on the amount staked between all stakers pro rata.

You don't want to nominate one with loads of DOT staked, as you want a bigger share of the reward. But not too low staked as may not be chosen and may not be trustworthy. Get one with total stake close to the lowest / average staked to become a validator. If they put their own stake in, that's not a big deal, but quite good if they use some. You can check how they did in the past, e.g. era points.  

Identity: optional for validators. They pay DOT to get registrars to check them. Registered are more trustworthy. Greyed out mean identity not yet validated. Or others have no identity.  

Commission: validator sets % of rewards they take before send to nominators. Range 0 to 100%. 100% is basically a sign they don't want more. Too high or too low is bad.  

Polkadot.js tells you lowest stake that becomes a validator and the average.

Looks like average bonded about 2.5m, total about 3.2m.
