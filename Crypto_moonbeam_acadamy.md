## intro

academy: https://academy.moonbeam.network/

Remix, hardhat, truffle, ethers.js are all compatible with moonbeam.

## Setup

Used metamask on chrome dev account
added moonbeam network to metamask
moonbeam account Dev1 0x43F6930f5fA42561C068aE589980634b04300a14

## Moonbeam background

Polkadot: 
- relay chain with parachains
- parachains are optimised for different applications
- rely chain passes messages between parachains
- moonbeam a parachain on polkadot, moonriver on Kusama
- shared security model. So parachains don't need to attract POS funds to validate. Parachains don't compete

Substrate:
- modular framework to build parachains
- can customise or bespoke dev for parachain

Moonbeam:
- Etherium compatible
- can use metamask
- aiming to be eay to migrate from Eth, BSC, polygon
- native on chain governance (not in Etherium)
- forkless upgrades (voted, automatic upgrades. Forkless, so no risk of 2 chains)
- interoperable with other Polkadot chains
- focussed on best ETH development experience
- Accounts are interoperable with Etherium and Polkadot. Most polkadot different addresses. Moonbeam has unified account structure, you can have a single address for Eth and Moonbeam.  

Why moonbeam:
- ecosystem of integrations
- services like the graph
- covalent for convenient account lookups
- block explorer https://moonscan.io/
- lots of tools

Eth compatability
- substrate has an EVM pallet
- frontier pallet provides state transition mapping.
