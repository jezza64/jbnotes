<h1>Statistics</h1>
<h2>Standardise</h2>
<p>set the mean to zero by subtracting the mean from all
points.</p>
<h2>Normalize</h2>
<p>divide by the standard deviation to get the number of
standard deviations.</p>
<h2>Standard deviation vs Standard error</h2>
<p>SE tells you the error because you
are working on a sample not the full distribution. On a sample from a
full distribution, get a mean and a standard deviation. If you had
multiple samples, would get multiple means and multiple standard
deviations. Could calculate the mean of means, and the standard
deviation of the standard deviations. Sd of the Sds is the standard
error. It tells you the uncertainty in the mean and standard deviation.
The odd thing is that from one distribution you can get the error even
when you are looking at one sample rather than the full distribution.
Use SD when looking at the sample, use SE when looking at the full
population. the standard deviation describes the spread of a sample;
standard error is a measure of the precision with which the sample
statistic approximates the true population value. The STANDARD ERROR is
the name given to the precision with which a sample estimate
approximates the population value. The standard error is not an estimate
of any quantity in the population, but is a measure of the uncertainty
of a single sample value as an estimate of the population value.</p>
